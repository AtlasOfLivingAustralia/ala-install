\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Hoser\" title=\"Raymond Hoser\"\u003eRaymond Hoser\u003c/a\u003e described two subspecies in 2003: \u003ci\u003ePseudechis porphyriacus eipperi\u003c/i\u003e the Atherton Tableland and surrounds in North-east Queensland, which he noted was smaller, rarely attaining 2 m (7 ft) and had a white or pale pink rather than red belly, and \u003ci\u003ePseudechis porphyriacus rentoni\u003c/i\u003e from southeastern South Australia, which has a variable-coloured (often orange or even blueish-tinged) belly. He added that both were disjunct from the main red-bellied black snake population, and as the distinguishing traits of \u003ci\u003eP. porphyriacus rentoni\u003c/i\u003e were not consistent then location was the most reliable way of identifying it.\u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#cite_note-hoser2003-14\"\u003e[14]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e These subspecies have not been recognized by other authors.\u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#cite_note-AFD-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e Hoser has been criticized by \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hinrich_Kaiser\u0026amp;action=edit\u0026amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Hinrich Kaiser (page does not exist)\"\u003eHinrich Kaiser\u003c/a\u003e and colleagues for identifying some taxa on location alone.\u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#cite_note-15\"\u003e[15]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e--
