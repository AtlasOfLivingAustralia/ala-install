# GBIF CESP 2018 demos

For the Madrid CESP 2018 workshop we have created an image that can be used to quickly start up a few ALA components.

These images are only intended for demonstration purposes. For production installation we recommend using the Ansible scripts with inventories for your environment.

## The Amazon EC2 image

This can be used by logging into Amazon EC2 and searching for "livingatlases-cesp-madrid-feb2018" in the community AMIs in the Frankfurt data centre.

The recommended VM to use is [t2.2xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)  ro equivalebt for the running the demo. The main requirement is a machine with 32GB of RAM as this demo runs a number of components/

## Notes

### Taxonomy
The taxonomy used in these demos is the [GBIF backbone taxonomy](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c) as downloaded on the early 2018.

The taxonomy has been imported into the BIE, and name indexes have also been generated.
