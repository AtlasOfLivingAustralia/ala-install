# TDWG 2017 demos

For TDWG we have created 2 images that can be used to quickly start up a few ALA components

* Virtualbox image
* Amazon EC2 image

## Virtualbox image

The virtual box image can be download from here:

https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/ala-virtualbox/ALA_DEMO_20170929.ova

It requires Virtualbox 5.x and a computer with at least 8GB of RAM.

Once you have this running (and the initial startup will take a couple of minutes), you should be able to access the components using the following URL:

http://demo.vagrant1.ala.org.au

## Amazon EC2 image

This can be used by logging into Amazon EC2 and searching for "ala-demo" in the community AMIs.
