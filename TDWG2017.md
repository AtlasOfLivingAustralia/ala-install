# TDWG 2017 demos

For TDWG we have created 2 images that can be used to quickly start up a few ALA components

* Virtualbox image
* Amazon EC2 image

These images are only intended for demonstration purposes. For production installation we recommend using the Ansible scripts with inventories for your environment.

## Virtualbox image

The virtual box image can be download from [here](https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/ala-virtualbox/ALA_DEMO_TDWG_2017.ova). Note it is approximately 3GB in size.

It requires [Virtualbox 5.x](https://www.virtualbox.org) and a computer with at least 8GB of RAM.

The initial startup may take a couple of minutes (depending on your machine). Once you have this running you should be able to access the components using the following URL:

http://demo.vagrant1.ala.org.au

To ssh to the running machine use the following command

```
ssh vagrant@demo.vagrant1.ala.org.au
```

and password is `vagrant`


## Amazon EC2 image

This can be used by logging into Amazon EC2 and searching for "ala-demo-tdwg" in the community AMIs.

The recommended VM to use is [m4.xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for the running the demo.
